## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Resume Matching

1. **Upload Resume**: Drag and drop or click to upload a resume file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT)
2. **AI Processing**: The system automatically parses the resume using OpenAI GPT-4o
3. **Job Matching**: Vector similarity algorithms find relevant job matches
4. **View Results**: Browse ranked job matches with confidence scores and skill overlaps

### Scalability Testing

1. **Generate Jobs**: Use the job generation API to create test datasets

```bash
# Generate 1000 general jobs
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/jobs/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"count": 1000, "type": "general"}'

# Generate 5000 tech-focused jobs
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/jobs/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"count": 5000, "type": "tech"}'
```

2. **Test Vector Strategies**: Compare different matching algorithms

```bash
# Test TF-IDF strategy
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/resume/1/matches/strategy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"strategy": "tfidf"}'

# Test skill-based matching
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/resume/1/matches/strategy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"strategy": "skill"}'
```

### Available Vector Strategies

#### 1. TF-IDF Strategy

- **Best for**: Large-scale text analysis and semantic understanding
- **Approach**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency vectorization
- **Pros**: Captures semantic relationships, scales well with large datasets
- **Cons**: May miss exact skill matches

#### 2. Skill-based Strategy

- **Best for**: Exact technical skill matching
- **Approach**: Direct skill overlap and experience level weighting
- **Pros**: Precise skill matching, fast computation
- **Cons**: May miss semantic similarities

#### 3. Hybrid Strategy

- **Best for**: Balanced approach combining multiple techniques
- **Approach**: 60% TF-IDF + 40% skill matching
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds, comprehensive matching
- **Cons**: Slightly more computation intensive

### Getting Help

Check the console logs for detailed error messages and API response information. The application includes comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error messages.

### macOS Rosetta Issues

If you're running on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 Macs), some Node.js modules might have compatibility issues. The dotenv loading problem can sometimes be related to architecture-specific builds. You need to clean reinstall your dependencies outside Rosetta to get the correct native binary.
