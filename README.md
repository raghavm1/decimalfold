## Data Models

### Job Schema

```typescript

  id: number;
  title: string;
  company: string;
  companySize?: string;        // e.g., "1000+ employees", "100-999 employees"

  industry: string;           // Default: "Technology"
  vector?: number[];          // OpenAI embedding (real array)
}
```

### Resume Schema

```typescript
{
  id: number;
  fileName: string;
  originalText: string;       // Full resume text IS stored in database
  parsedData: ParsedResumeData;
  vector?: number[];          // OpenAI embedding (real array)
  uploadedAt: string;
}
```

### Parsed Resume Data

  experienceLevel: string;
  primaryRole: string;
  industries: string[];
  yearsOfExperience: number;
  languageProcessing?: {
    detectedLanguage: string;

  };
}
```

}
```

## Production Deployment

### Current Hosting Setup

The application is currently deployed using:

- **Vercel** - Frontend hosting with automatic deployments from Git
- **Render** - Backend API hosting with Node.js runtime
- **Neon** - Managed PostgreSQL database
- **Pinecone** - Vector database for similarity search

### Important: Render Cold Start Behavior

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note about backend availability**: The backend is hosted on Render's free tier, which has the following behavior:

- **Automatic Sleep**: The backend service goes to sleep after **15 minutes of inactivity**
- **Cold Start Delay**: When accessing the application after inactivity, the backend undergoes a **cold start process** that can take up to **1 minute**
- **User Experience**: During cold start, API requests may timeout or fail until the backend fully boots up

**What this means for users:**

- First-time visitors or users returning after 15+ minutes of site inactivity may experience slow initial load times
- Retrieving all jobs, resume uploads and job matching may fail on the first attempt after a cold start, but will work after around 50 seconds
- The application will work normally once the backend has fully started

### Build Optimizations

Build artifacts are optimized with:

- Client-side code splitting and tree shaking
- Server-side bundle optimization with esbuild
- Environment-specific configurations

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

- **Cons**: May miss semantic similarities

#### 3. Hybrid Strategy

- **Best for**: Balanced approach combining multiple techniques
- **Approach**: 60% TF-IDF + 40% skill matching
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds, comprehensive matching
- **Cons**: Slightly more computation intensive

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI Token Limit Errors**

   - The application automatically truncates text to fit within token limits
   - Check your OpenAI API key and rate limits

2. **File Upload Issues**

   - Ensure files are under 10MB
   - Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT
   - Check file permissions and disk space

### macOS Rosetta Issues

If you're running on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 Macs), some Node.js modules might have compatibility issues. The dotenv loading problem can sometimes be related to architecture-specific builds. You need to clean reinstall your dependencies outside Rosetta to get the correct native binary.
